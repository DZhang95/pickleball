General approach
Start w/ initial velocity and spin (angular velocity) for ball
Calculate the initial impulse of the ball
Calculate collisions
For each collision, calculate the impulse of the impact on the ball
Sum up the impulses
Calculate the new veloctiy and spin of the ball

Gravity not considered for 2D implementation

Calculation for impact of collisions on the ball:
Definitions:

    M: Ball mass (0.026 kg)

    m: Air particle mass (0.0001 kg)

    R: Ball radius

    v_ball: Velocity of the ball's center (vector)

    ω: Angular velocity (spin) of the ball (vector)

    u_air: Velocity of the air particle (vector). For still air, this is (0, 0, 0).

    r: Vector from the ball's center to the collision point. Its magnitude is R.

    n: Unit normal vector at the collision point = r / R.
    
Calculate surface veloctiy at point of impact:
v_surface = v_ball + (ω × r)
Calculate Relative Velocity:
v_rel = u_air - v_surface
Calculate Impulse for one collision:
J = 2 * m * dot(v_rel, n) * n
Aggregate impulses of all collisions by adding them. Then update ball state:
New Linear Velocity: 
v_ball_new = v_ball + (J / M)
New Angular Velocity: 
ω_new = ω + (cross(r, J) / I)
Moment of Inertia (I): 
I = (2/5) * M * R²

pickleball court dimensions
Width: 20 ft × 0.3048 = 6.096 m
Length: 44 ft × 0.3048 = 13.4112 m
Height: 10 ft × 0.3048 = 3.048 m
granularity: 1 cm -> about 249 million cells

Ball is 26g
Ball diameter is 74mm
Air particles are not calculated individually, they are instead simulated as "parcels" of air.
Air parcels are 0.1g
3 million air parcels in the court?


expected collisions second = (ρ × A × v) / m_air
where A is the cross-sectional area of the ball (A=πR^2), R=0.037 (radius from diameter 74 mm), and v is the ball's speed.
~526 collisions per second when v = 10 m/s
time step = 0.001s
